# Clouptima_interview_assessment
This repository consists of the optimised code that is written for the assessment <br>
I've used the max-heap priority_queue<> in -built data structure to do this in O(n*logn) time complexity <br>
Which I believe is the best time complexity possible to achieve, there's a similar approach using binary search which would cost somewhere about the same time complexity.
